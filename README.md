## Compatibility list - Issue creating rules
1. Make sure there is no issue posted for your game already;
2. We accept issues only in English, but it's ok if provided screenshots/videos contains non-English text;
3. Log files are required. Issues without logs will be closed in 24 hrs (the only exception is ingame with no issues and playable reports, if the game works perfectly fine for you then no need to include the log files);
4. Every issue report you make should be posted **WITHOUT** community patches enabled;
5. Try to provide as much info as possible, this is the key to solving your issue;
6. Your log files should be in FileBin format \(*.p7d\). You cannot upload said files directly to GitHub, you should compress them into a zip/tar/7z archive and then attach the resulting archive to your issue.
